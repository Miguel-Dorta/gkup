# gkup
**WARNING:** Do NOT use it! This program stills in its alpha development phase.

gkup is a backup tool whose aim is to reduce file redundancy to a minimum. This will save a lot of space in your backup drives, avoiding multiple copies of the same files over and over.

The backups generated are also designed to be human-readable, so they'll be easily restorable even if all the copies of this program are erased of the surface of the Earth, and they'll also be easily parseable by other programs.

It isn't aimed to provide any kind of compression, encryption or redundancy. It's the user's' responsibility to do this if they feel they wanted.
